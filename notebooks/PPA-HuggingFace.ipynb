    "The problem of resolving ambiguity in prepositional phrase attachment is one that remains largely unsolved in NLP, and one that pre-trained language models such as BERT will likely not be of much help with. This notebook shows results of predicting prepositional phrase attachments across a subset of the NLVR2 dataset which has been annotated, leveraging a pre-trained language model commonly known as \"BERT\" (cite). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first group of models are trained from the output (hidden layers) of the large uncased model from BERT with whole word masking. The results are presented in terms of Cohen's kappa score and F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second group of models are trained without the aid of a language model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our expectation is that none of these models will perform very well on its own. Results should be comparable between the two groups. \n"
